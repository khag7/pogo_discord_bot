1. Create a discord bot
2. Grant that bot permission to post on whatever channel you want
3. Edit bot.py -- top of file needs a google maps API key, your bot token from discord, and a channel ID to post in
4. Also bot.py on line 58-ish, you need to put channels there too (currently it has two, one is a text channel and one is voice)
